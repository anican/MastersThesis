I would like to express my deepest thanks to all those who have helped throughout my educational journey.
Thank you to my research mentor Arvind Krishnamurthy for his mentorship and guidance. I started systems research late in my undergrad, and Arvind was the best mentor I could have asked for. He always makes one-on-one time for his students and has excellent research vision. He inspires me to be a better researcher, teacher, and computer scientist. 

I would like to thank the members of the UW Systems Lab for their insight and feedback throughout
this process. In particular, thank you to Lequn Chen for always helping me with whatever questions I had and for providing significant guidance on this project and others. I also appreciate Xiangfeng Zhu for sharing advice and resources. Thank you so much to Tom Anderson and Simon Peter for your mentorship, guidance, and wisdom. 

Thank you so much to my friends and family. I wouldn't be here without all of your support. In particular, thank you to my parents Anu and Sridhar for giving me unconditional love and support even when I mess up. Thank you to my brothers and sister in arms; Ashika, Avinash, Santhu, Sumanth and Vishal.
